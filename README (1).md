## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Database and Table Creation

A database `Portfolio_Project` is created with a single table `retail_sales3` including fields like transaction ID, sale date and time, customer demographics, product category, quantity, COGS, and total sales.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning

The cleaning step removes any records with missing (`NULL`) values in important columns to ensure data quality.

```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales3
WHERE age IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL OR sale_date IS NULL OR quantiy IS NULL;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration

Simple queries are run to understand the size, diversity, and scope of the data:
- Total number of sales
- Unique customer count
- Number of distinct product categories

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Business Questions Answered

#### Q1. **Sales on November 5, 2022**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales3 WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```
Used to analyze a specific promotional or holiday sales day.

#### Q2. **High-quantity clothing sales in Nov-2022**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales3 WHERE category='Clothing' AND MONTH(sale_date) = 11 AND quantiy >= 4;
```
To identify strong seasonal or promotional product segments.

#### Q3. **Net sales by category**
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) net_sales , COUNT(*) total_orders FROM retail_sales3 GROUP BY category;
```
Used to evaluate product category performance.

#### Q4. **Average age of Beauty product customers**
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age)) FROM retail_sales3 WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```
Informs demographic targeting for cosmetics marketing.

#### Q5. **Transactions with total sales > $1000**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales3 WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```
Finds high-value transactions likely linked to premium products or loyal customers.

#### Q6. **Sales count by gender and category**
```sql
SELECT category, gender, COUNT(transactions_id) FROM retail_sales3 GROUP BY category, gender;
```
Useful for gender-based marketing insights.

#### Q7. **Best-selling months (based on average sales)**
```sql
-- Uses RANK to find top 2 average sale months
```
Helps uncover seasonal patterns to optimize inventory and campaigns.

#### Q8. **Top 5 customers by total purchase value**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) total_sale FROM retail_sales3 GROUP BY customer_id ORDER BY total_sale DESC LIMIT 5;
```
Targets potential VIP customers.

#### Q9. **Unique customers per category**
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales3 GROUP BY category;
```
Determines category-wise reach.

#### Q10. **Sales by time shift (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)**
```sql
-- Uses HOUR() to split sales into three shifts
```
Supports resource planning and time-based promotions.
